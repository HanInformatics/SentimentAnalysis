# Sentiment Analysis

**How different are sentiment and emotion?**

**Sentiment** is a general thought, feeling, or sense while **emotion** is a person's internal state of being and involuntary physiological response to an object or a situation, based on or tied to physical state and sensory data. So, then anlaysis of linguistic expressions of thought, feeling or sense are sentiment analysis rather than emotion analysis. 


**생각이 언어로 표출된다는 전제 하에, 좋고 나쁨은 생각과 언어에 의해 결정된다.**

From "No fear Shakespeare: Hamlet: Act 2 Scene 2"

'There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so'...
